Dear $username,

	An approval was recently processed at $sitename for a personal
introduction you initiated.

	You are now connected to '$fn' at '$dfrn_url'. 

Your access privileges to this profile MAY have been elevated. Please
view their profile from within your $sitename "Contacts" page going 
forward. Should you visit the URL without going through $sitename,
you will only see this person's public profile. 

At $sitename, "relationships" are allowed to be one sided. Be advised 
that your communications with this person may be partially limited 
if they do not request (and you accept) a reciprocal relationship.

You may now send them directed messages, and you also may have the 
ability to receive non-public status messages and view otherwise 
hidden profiles. Should this turn into a mutual relationship you 
will both have this level of access.


Sincerely,

	$sitename Administrator
